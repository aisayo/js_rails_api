# How to setup a Full Stack application

- There are going to be two directories that we are directly dealing with: `JS Directory` and `Rails Directory`
- We can handle these separate directories in two ways:
    1. We can create 1 folder that houses both the JS and Rails folders. To do this follow these steps:
        - Create a parent directory meant to house both JS and Rails folders: i.e. `mkdir gaming_app`
        - `cd` into this new directory and create a 'client-side' folder (this is where your JS code will be written)
