# Hello, Serializers

- Serializers allow us to encapsulate our modifications to our data structures and distribute it to our controller actions much more organized
- There are a few serializers to use: [ActiveModel Serializer](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) and [fast JSON:API](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi)
